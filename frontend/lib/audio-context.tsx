/**
 * Audio Context Re-exports
 *
 * All functionality is split into three separate contexts for better performance:
 *
 * - audio-state-context.tsx - Rarely changing data (currentTrack, queue, etc.)
 * - audio-playback-context.tsx - Frequently changing data (currentTime, isPlaying)
 * - audio-controls-context.tsx - Actions only (play, pause, next, etc.)
 *
 * Import from these files directly for optimal performance.
 * This file provides convenient re-exports for backward compatibility.
