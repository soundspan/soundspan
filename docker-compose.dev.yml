# Compatibility shim (temporary).
#
# Deprecated:
# - Use `docker-compose.local.yml` for local host-run testing.
# - This file exists only so existing `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ...`
#   commands continue to work during the transition period.
#
# Planned removal:
# - Remove this shim after local scripts/docs/users have fully moved to
#   `docker-compose.local.yml`.
