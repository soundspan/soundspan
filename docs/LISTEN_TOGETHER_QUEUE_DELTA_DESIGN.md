# Listen Together: Queue Delta Protocol (Phase 2 Design)

Status: **Proposed** | Created: 2026-03-05

## Context

Listen Together broadcasts the full queue array on every mutation via `group:state` and `group:queue-delta` events. With the queue limit raised to 2000 tracks (Phase 1), each broadcast can be 400KB-1MB. This works but is wasteful — most mutations only add, remove, or reorder a single track.

Phase 1 (completed) raised the `maxHttpBufferSize` to 5MB and the queue limit to 2000, fixing the hard-refresh disconnect bug. This document describes Phase 2: sending incremental queue operations instead of full replacements.

## Current Architecture

### Broadcast paths that include the full queue

| Call site | Trigger | Queue changes? |
|---|---|---|
| `modifyQueue()` → `onQueueDelta` | add, insert-next, remove, clear | Yes |
| `setTrack()` → `broadcastState` | next/prev/jump | No |
| `addSocket()` → `broadcastState` | Socket reconnect (presence) | No |
| `removeSocket()` → `broadcastState` | Socket disconnect (presence) | No |
| `addMember()` → `broadcastState` | Member join/rejoin | No |
| `removeMember()` → `broadcastState` | Member leave | No |
| `forcePlay()` → `broadcastState` | Ready gate passes | No |

### Key types (current)

```typescript
// listenTogetherManager.ts — misleadingly named, this is a full replacement
export interface QueueDelta {
    queue: SyncQueueItem[];      // entire queue array
    currentIndex: number;
    trackId: string | null;
    stateVersion: number;
}

// The manager already has structured action types
export type QueueAction =
    | { action: "add"; items: SyncQueueItem[] }
    | { action: "insert-next"; items: SyncQueueItem[] }
    | { action: "remove"; index: number }
    | { action: "reorder"; fromIndex: number; toIndex: number }
    | { action: "clear" };
```

## Proposed Design

### 1. New `QueueOp` event type

Replace full-queue broadcasts from `modifyQueue()` with operation-based deltas:

```typescript
export type QueueOp =
    | { op: "add"; items: SyncQueueItem[]; currentIndex: number; trackId: string | null; stateVersion: number }
    | { op: "insert-next"; afterIndex: number; items: SyncQueueItem[]; currentIndex: number; trackId: string | null; stateVersion: number }
    | { op: "remove"; index: number; currentIndex: number; trackId: string | null; stateVersion: number }
    | { op: "clear"; stateVersion: number };
```

New Socket.IO event: `group:queue-op`

### 2. Manager changes (`listenTogetherManager.ts`)

- Add `onQueueOp(groupId, op)` to `ManagerCallbacks`
- In `modifyQueue()`, emit the structured op instead of (or in addition to) the full queue
- Keep `onQueueDelta` as a fallback for cluster sync / backward compat during rollout

### 3. Socket layer changes (`listenTogetherSocket.ts`)

- Wire `onQueueOp` callback to emit `group:queue-op` to the room
- Keep `group:state` for initial join/reconnect (full snapshot catch-up path)

### 4. Client changes

#### `listen-together-socket.ts`
- Add `onQueueOp` callback to `ListenTogetherSocketCallbacks`
- Listen on `group:queue-op` event

#### `listen-together-context.tsx`
- Add `applyQueueOp()` handler that applies each op locally:
  - `add`: append items to queue array
  - `insert-next`: splice items after `afterIndex`
  - `remove`: splice out item at index, adjust `currentIndex`
  - `clear`: reset queue to empty
- Gap detection: if `op.stateVersion > lastAppliedVersion + 1`, request full resync

### 5. Gap detection and resync

```typescript
const applyQueueOp = useCallback((op: QueueOp) => {
    if (op.stateVersion <= lastAppliedVersionRef.current) return; // stale
    if (op.stateVersion > lastAppliedVersionRef.current + 1) {
        // Missed one or more ops — request full state
        listenTogetherSocket.requestResync();
        return;
    }
    lastAppliedVersionRef.current = op.stateVersion;
    // ... apply op locally
}, []);
```

Add `requestResync()` to the client socket class — emits `request-resync` to server. Server responds with `group:state` (full snapshot) to that socket only.

### 6. Split `broadcastState` for non-queue changes

Several `broadcastState` calls fire for presence-only changes (member connect/disconnect/join/leave). These don't change the queue but still send the full queue array. Convert these to a lightweight `group:members-delta` event:

```typescript
export interface MembersDelta {
    members: Array<{
        userId: string;
        username: string;
        isHost: boolean;
        joinedAt: string;
        isConnected: boolean;
    }>;
    syncState: GroupSyncState;
    stateVersion: number;
}
```

Call sites to convert:
- `addSocket()` line 429 — presence transition
- `removeSocket()` line 444 — presence transition
- `addMember()` lines 481, 501 — member join
- `removeMember()` line 551 — member leave

Call sites that should stay as `broadcastState` (full snapshot):
- `setTrack()` lines 669, 682 — clients need full state for track change + ready gate
- `forcePlay()` line 1150 — clients need full state after ready gate resolves

### 7. Cluster sync considerations

The Redis cluster sync (`listenTogetherClusterSync.ts`) currently publishes full `GroupSnapshot` objects. This should continue — cluster sync is periodic (not per-mutation) and needs the authoritative full state. No changes needed here.

## Bandwidth Impact

| Scenario (2000 tracks) | Current | With QueueOp |
|---|---|---|
| Add 1 track | ~600KB | ~0.5KB |
| Remove 1 track | ~600KB | ~0.1KB |
| Next/prev track | ~600KB | ~0.3KB (PlaybackDelta) |
| Member join/leave | ~600KB | ~2KB (MembersDelta) |
| Initial join / resync | ~600KB | ~600KB (full snapshot, unchanged) |

## Migration Strategy

1. Server emits **both** `group:queue-op` and `group:queue-delta` during rollout
2. Updated clients listen for `group:queue-op` and ignore `group:queue-delta` when ops are available
3. Legacy clients continue receiving `group:queue-delta` (full replacement)
4. After all clients update, remove `group:queue-delta` emission

## Risk Assessment

**Client queue divergence** is the primary risk. If a client misses a `queue-op` (flaky WebSocket, browser tab backgrounded), their queue silently drifts from the server. Mitigations:
- `stateVersion` gap detection triggers immediate full resync
- Full `group:state` snapshot continues to fire for track changes and ready gates
- `requestResync` provides explicit recovery path

**Testing requirements:**
- Unit tests for each op type applied to client-side queue state
- Tests for gap detection triggering resync
- Tests for out-of-order / duplicate op handling
- Integration test: add tracks on one client, verify other client's queue matches
