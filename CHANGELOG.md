## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Rebrand baseline initialized for soundspan.
- Added a one-command maintainer release-prep flow (`npm run release:prepare -- --version X.Y.Z`) that synchronizes frontend/backend package versions, Helm chart version/appVersion, and release image tags, with hard-coded package-name validation.
- Helm chart release workflow now waits for release-tagged GHCR images before publishing chart artifacts to `gh-pages`.

### Changed

- Clarified mobile direction across README, migration guidance, and device-link UI copy: soundspan is PWA-first, with Subsonic-compatible apps as mobile native clients.

### Fixed

- Activity Social tab no longer flickers to "Social status unavailable" during transient refresh failures when cached online users are already available.
