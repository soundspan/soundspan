## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- Album track rows now use a three-dot overflow menu between duration and thumbs controls for Add to Queue/Add to Playlist actions, reducing action clutter while preserving existing behavior.

### Fixed

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added a canonical release notes template (`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`) and generator workflow (`npm run release:notes`) for repeatable release publishing.
- Added queue-end auto Match Vibe continuation so playback can extend automatically when repeat is off and Listen Together is not active.
- Added shared thumbs preference controls and supporting tests across player/list surfaces (`trackPreferenceSignals`, shared button component, and regression coverage).

### Changed

- Clarified product direction and branding language across docs/UI: soundspan is PWA-first for first-party mobile, with Subsonic-compatible apps as native mobile clients.
- Extended thumbs preference actions to the playback and list surfaces where users triage tracks (overlay, full player, album tracks, and playlist rows).
- Updated thumbs visuals to icon-only controls with solid white active state and removed the overlay thumbs pill/container chrome.
- Strengthened local agent governance for shared `.agents/**` concurrency handling and documented/enforced release-notes process policy.

### Fixed

- Reduced repeated-artist clustering across radio/vibe/discovery recommendation paths and applied light thumbs weighting.
- Fixed repeated thumbs taps so active thumbs-up/down cleanly toggle back to neutral; opposite action now cleanly overrides prior state.
- Fixed intermittent UI navigation stalls by re-enabling sidebar route prefetch and bypassing Next.js route-transition requests in the service worker.

## [1.0.1]

### Added

- Added a one-command maintainer release-prep flow (`npm run release:prepare -- --version X.Y.Z`) that synchronizes frontend/backend package versions, Helm chart version/appVersion, and release image tags, with hard-coded package-name validation.
- Helm chart release workflow now waits for release-tagged GHCR images before publishing chart artifacts to `gh-pages`.

### Fixed

- Activity Social tab no longer flickers to "Social status unavailable" during transient refresh failures when cached online users are already available.

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- Rebrand baseline initialized for soundspan.
